# 1) Dailogue Act Recognition

Dialogue Act Recognition (DAR) is a sub-task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying the intention or action behind a speaker's utterance in a conversation. It's about recognizing the function or purpose of a sentence or phrase in a dialogue, such as:<br>
<br>
**Making a statement** (e.g., "I'm going to the store.")<br>
**Asking a question** (e.g., "What time is it?")<br>
**Giving a command** (e.g., "Close the door.")<br>
**Expressing an opinion** (e.g., "I love this restaurant.")<br>
**Apologizing** (e.g., "Sorry about that.")<br>
