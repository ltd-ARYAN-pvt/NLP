## 2) Sentiment Analysis using X-NLP

This work proposal describes developing a sophisticated sentiment analysis system called "Sentiment Analysis using XNLP." It will utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The main goal is to create an advanced sentiment analysis model that accurately categorizes sentiments in diverse textual data and provides transparent explanations for its predictions.

Motivated by the need for transparent and interpretable sentiment analysis models, this work aims to overcome the limitations of traditional models by incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques. By integrating XAI with the trained NLP model, users can gain insights into how sentiment classifications are made, thereby enhancing trust and understanding of the model's predictions.

This study focuses on sentiment analysis in the Sp1786 dataset and tweets using X-NLP. We are training two machine learning models (statistical & deep learning) on a large dataset consisting of 1.6 million tweets. Currently, the models are undergoing training, and we are also developing an XAI framework to explain model predictions. LIME is the current method being used, and attention mechanisms are being considered for future use. Implementing XAI is expected to enhance our understanding of the modelsâ€™ decision-making process, ultimately increasing trust in their predictions.
