## 2) Sentiment Analysis using X-NLP

This work proposal outlines the development of a sophisticated sentiment analysis system, titled "Sentiment Analysis using XNLP," leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The primary objective is to create an advanced sentiment analysis model that not only accurately categorizes sentiments in diverse textual data but also provides transparent explanations for its predictions.

Motivated by the necessity for transparent and interpretable sentiment analysis models, the work aims to address the limitations of conventional models by incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques. By integrating XAI with the trained NLP model, users can gain insights into how sentiment classifications are made, enhancing trust and comprehension in the model's predictions.

This work explores sentiment analysis in the Sp1786 dataset
 and tweets using X-NLP. We train two machine learning
 models (statistical & deep learning) on a large dataset (1.6
 million tweets).& Currently, models are being trained and
 an XAI framework is being developed to explain model
 predictions. LIME is the current method under use and at
tention mechanisms are being considered for the future. XAI
 implementation is expected to improve our understanding of
 the modelsâ€™ decision-making process, leading to greater trust
 in their predictions.
